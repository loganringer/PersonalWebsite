                    <p class="typewriter">I'm a Senior in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. I've taken a wide array of classes in Computer Science, such as theory, data structures, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and have been able to maintain above a 3.5 GPA.</p>

                    <p class="typewriter">I've had two internships thus far, one with Apple Leisure Group, and one with Starbucks. During my time with Apple Leisure Group, I worked on a web development team of four people, where we redesigned dreamsresorts.com and implemented a new CMS, Adobe Experience Manager. I specifically dealt with the front end design and development of various web components using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My internship at ALG led to a full time role through the remainder of the dreamsresorts.com project and I will be returning to continue work on the various other websites in August. At Starbucks, I designed and developed a web UI tool that monitors purchase orders for the Starbucks retail stores using the REST API, Javascript, and Angular 2.0. I also implemented data and query indexing into Starbucks' search engine using elastic search.</p>

                    <p class="typewriter">In my free time, I like to create 3D scenes and animations. This year I've been able to create a wide array of different scenes and objects, some of which include very realistic donuts and am animated camp fire. I have a creative mind and love computers, so I've mashed together my passion for technology and creativity by picking up animation as a hobby.</p>
