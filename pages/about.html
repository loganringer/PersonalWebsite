                    <p class="typewriter">I've had two internships thus far, one with <b>Apple Leisure Group</b>, and one with <b>Starbucks</b>.
                    At Apple Leisure Group, I worked on a web development team of four people, where we redesigned dreamsresorts.com and implemented Adobe Experience Manager. I specifically dealt with the front end design and development of various web components using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My internship at ALG led to a full time role through the remainder of the dreamsresorts.com project.
                    At Starbucks, I developed an API Permissions console using an array of technologies such as the latest release of Angular, Jenkins, and Gulp. It is a role based web UI tool that manages authorization to services.</p>

                    <p class="typewriter">In my free time, I like to create 3D scenes and animations. This year I've been able to create a wide array of different scenes and objects, some of which include very realistic donuts and am animated camp fire. I have a creative mind and love computers, so I've mashed together my passion for technology and creativity by picking up animation as a hobby.</p>
